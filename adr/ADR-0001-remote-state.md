# ADR-0001: Terraform Remote State Management & Locking Strategy

## Status
**Accepted** (Day 01 - September 11, 2025)

## Context

### Problem Statement
As we build enterprise-grade AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), we need a robust, secure, and scalable solution for Terraform state management that supports:

- **Multi-team collaboration** across development, staging, and production environments
- **State isolation** between environments and services
- **Concurrent access protection** to prevent state corruption
- **Audit trail** for compliance and change tracking
- **Disaster recovery** capabilities for business continuity
- **Security controls** meeting enterprise standards (encryption, access control)
- **Cost optimization** while maintaining reliability

### Current Challenges
- Local state files are not suitable for team collaboration
- Risk of state corruption with concurrent Terraform operations
- No centralized audit trail for infrastructure changes
- Inconsistent backup and recovery procedures
- Lack of encryption for sensitive infrastructure metadata

### Business Requirements
- Support for multiple AWS accounts (dev, staging, prod)
- Compliance with data encryption standards
- Automated backup and retention policies
- Role-based access control aligned with least privilege
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipelines
- Scalable to 50+ engineers across multiple teams

## Decision

### Primary Solution
**AWS S3 + DynamoDB backend** with the following architecture:

#### State Storage (S3)
- **Bucket naming**: `tfstate-{environment}-{account-id}-{region}`
- **Structure**: `{service}/{environment}/{component}/terraform.tfstate`
- **Encryption**: Server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)
- **Versioning**: Enabled with lifecycle policies
- **Access logging**: Centralized to dedicated audit bucket

#### State Locking (DynamoDB)
- **Table naming**: `terraform-locks-{environment}-{account-id}`
- **Primary key**: `LockID` (String)
- **Billing mode**: On-demand (cost-optimized)
- **Point-in-time recovery**: Enabled
- **Encryption**: Server-side encryption with AWS managed keys

#### Multi-Environment Strategy
```
Production Account:
├── tfstate-prod-123456789012-us-east-1/
│   ├── networking/prod/vpc/terraform.tfstate
│   ├── compute/prod/eks/terraform.tfstate
│   └── data/prod/rds/terraform.tfstate

Staging Account:
├── tfstate-staging-234567890123-us-east-1/
│   ├── networking/staging/vpc/terraform.tfstate
│   └── compute/staging/eks/terraform.tfstate

Development Account:
├── tfstate-dev-345678901234-us-east-1/
    ├── networking/dev/vpc/terraform.tfstate
    └── compute/dev/eks/terraform.tfstate
```

## Rationale

### Technical Benefits
1. **AWS Native Integration**
   - Leverages existing AWS security controls and IAM
   - No additional third-party dependencies
   - Seamless integration with AWS services

2. **Cost Effectiveness**
   - S3 Standard-IA after 30 days, Glacier after 90 days
   - DynamoDB on-demand billing for variable workloads
   - Estimated cost: $10-50/month vs $500+/month for Terraform Cloud Enterprise

3. **Security & Compliance**
   - End-to-end encryption (in-transit and at-rest)
   - Fine-grained IAM policies with resource-level permissions
   - CloudTrail integration for complete audit trail
   - VPC endpoints for private access

4. **Reliability & Performance**
   - 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability with S3
   - Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
   - Consistent performance with DynamoDB global tables

### Enterprise Security Model

#### IAM Roles & Policies
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/TerraformExecutionRole"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::tfstate-ENV-ACCOUNT/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Access Patterns
- **Terraform Execution Role**: Full state access within environment
- **Read-Only Role**: State inspection for monitoring/auditing
- **Emergency Break-Glass Role**: Cross-environment access for incidents
- **CI/CD Service Role**: Automated deployment permissions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)
- [ ] Create S3 buckets with security configurations
- [ ] Setup DynamoDB tables with encryption
- [ ] Implement IAM roles and policies
- [ ] Configure backend configurations

### Phase 2: Security Hardening (Day 1-2)
- [ ] Enable S3 access logging to audit bucket
- [ ] Configure VPC endpoints for private access
- [ ] Setup CloudTrail for API monitoring
- [ ] Implement bucket policies with MFA requirements

### Phase 3: Operational Excellence (Day 2-3)
- [ ] Lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- [ ] Cross-region replication for DR
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Backup verification procedures

### Configuration Example
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "tfstate-dev-345678901234-us-east-1"
    key            = "networking/dev/vpc/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    kms_key_id     = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:345678901234:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks-dev-345678901234"
    
    # Optional: Use assume role for cross-account access
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::345678901234:role/TerraformExecutionRole"
  }
}
```

**Pros**: Service discovery integration, dynamic configuration
**Cons**: Additional infrastructure complexity, operational overhead
**Decision**: Over-engineering for current requirements

### Option 3: Git-based State (Atlantis)
**Pros**: Version control integration, familiar workflow
**Cons**: Large state files in Git, merge conflicts, security concerns
**Decision**: Not suitable for production environments

### Option 4: Self-hosted PostgreSQL
**Pros**: Open source, familiar technology stack
**Cons**: Database management overhead, scaling challenges
**Decision**: Adds unnecessary operational complexity

## Monitoring & Alerting

### CloudWatch Metrics
- S3 bucket size and request metrics
- DynamoDB read/write capacity and throttling
- Failed Terraform operations via CloudTrail

### Alerts Configuration
```yaml
Alerts:
  - StateFileSize: >50MB (indicates need for component separation)
  - DynamoDBErrors: Any failed lock operations
  - UnauthorizedAccess: Access attempts outside business hours
  - BackupFailures: Cross-region replication issues
```

## Compliance & Governance

### Data Classification
