Create a 2-week structured learning plan to build enterprise-ready AWS skills, with a focus on hands-on practice, POCs, and documentation.

Key Requirements:

Leverage AI Tools: Use GitHub Copilot (and similar AI assistants) throughout the journey to accelerate learning, generate boilerplate code, and improve productivity.

AWS Core Topics (Senior Cloud Engineer Level): Cover all essential AWS concepts expected from a senior cloud engineer, including:

AWS Well-Architected Framework & core architecture patterns

VPC, Subnets, Routing, Transit Gateway, Direct Connect, Security Groups, NACLs

IAM (roles, policies, identity federation, least privilege design)

Storage (S3, EBS, EFS, FSx, Glacier) and lifecycle management

Compute (EC2, Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, Lambda, Fargate)

Databases (RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, caching with ElastiCache)

Monitoring & Logging (CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config)

Cost Optimization & Billing (Budgets, Cost Explorer, Reserved Instances, Savings Plans)

Security & Compliance (KMS, Secrets Manager, GuardDuty, Inspector, Organizations, SCPs)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Learn and apply Terraform to provision and manage AWS resources.

AWS Management Console / MCP: Practice connecting, configuring, and operating resources through AWS MCP and CLI.

EKS & Kubernetes Ecosystem: Put strong emphasis on AWS EKS, Kubernetes, Helm, and ArgoCD for deployment automation and GitOps practices.

Hands-On POCs: Include practical mini-projects/POCs for each major topic, with step-by-step guidance.

Documentation: Ensure all learnings and POCs are documented as if preparing enterprise-grade technical documentation.

Expected Output:

A day-by-day action plan for 14 days.

Tools and resources to be used (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Terraform, kubectl, Helm, ArgoCD).

Suggested POCs for each topic.

Integration of AI tools in each step (how to ask Copilot, what prompts to use, how to validate outputs).

Focus on outcomes that prepare for real-world senior cloud engineer scenarios.
